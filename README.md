# Buggytriangle
Overview:
This project demonstrates the process of testing, debugging, and improving an existing Python program that classifies triangles based on the lengths of their sides. The goal is to write and enhance a test suite for the program, identify any defects, fix them, and finally report the test results.

Objective:

Developing Unit Tests: Creating a comprehensive set of unit tests to validate the correctness of the triangle classification function.

Identifying and Fixing Bugs: Using test cases to discover defects in the triangle classification logic and then fixing the errors without rewriting the entire code.

Handling Edge Cases: Ensuring the function handles unexpected and invalid inputs such as imaginary numbers, strings, and more than three inputs.
